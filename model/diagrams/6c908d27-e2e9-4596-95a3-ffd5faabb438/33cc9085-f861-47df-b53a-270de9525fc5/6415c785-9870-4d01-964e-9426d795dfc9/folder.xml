    documentation="In this chapter, we looked at MongoDB, a powerful document-oriented database. We utilized it and made use of Mocha to implement an automated test for the database layer. Now it is time to build a fully-fledged RESTful web service. In the next chapter, we will extend the user-defined module by including support for searching via document attributes, and add filtering and pagination capabilities that will finally evolve into full-fledged RESTful service implementation."/>
