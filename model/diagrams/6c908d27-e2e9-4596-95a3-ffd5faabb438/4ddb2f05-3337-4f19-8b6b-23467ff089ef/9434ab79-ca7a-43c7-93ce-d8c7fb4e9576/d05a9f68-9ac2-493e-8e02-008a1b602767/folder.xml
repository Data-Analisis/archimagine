    documentation="Unfortunately, nvm does not support Windows. Fortunately, a couple of Windows- specific clones of the nvm concept exist:&#xA;https:/​/​github.​com/​coreybutler/​nvm-​windows https:/​/​github.​com/​marcelklehr/​nodist&#xA;Another route is to use the WSL. Because in WSL you're interacting with a Linux command line, you can use nvm itself.&#xA;Many of the examples in this book were tested using the nvm-windows application. There are slight behavior differences, but it acts largely the same as nvm for Linux and macOS. The biggest change is the version number specifier in the nvm use and nvm install commands.&#xA;With nvm for Linux and macOS one can type a simple version number, like nvm use 8, and it will automatically substitute the latest release of the named Node.js version. With nvm-windows the same command acts as if you typed &quot;nvm use 8.0.0&quot;. In other words, with nvm-windows you must use the exact version number. Fortunately, the list of supported versions is easily available using the &quot;nvm list available&quot; command."/>
