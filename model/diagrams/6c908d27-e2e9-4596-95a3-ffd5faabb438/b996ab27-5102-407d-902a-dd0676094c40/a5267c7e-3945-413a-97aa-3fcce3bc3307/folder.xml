    documentation="While we came a long way in this chapter, maybe Facebook doesn't have anything to fear from the baby steps we took toward converting the Notes application into a social network. This chapter gave us the opportunity to explore some really cool technology for pseudo real-time communication between browser sessions.&#xA;Look up the technical definition for the phrase real time and you'll see the real-time web is not truly real time. The actual meaning of real time involves software with strict time boundaries that must respond to events within a specified time constraint. Real-time software is typically used in embedded systems to respond to button presses, for applications as diverse as junk food dispensers and medical devices in intensive care units. Eat too much junk food and you could end up in intensive care, and be served by real-time software in both cases. Try and remember the distinction between different meanings for this phrase.&#xA;In this chapter, you learned about using Socket.IO for pseudo real-time web experiences, using the EventEmitter class to send messages between parts of an application, jQuery, AJAX, and other browser-side JavaScript technologies, while avoiding page reloads while making AJAX calls.&#xA;In the next chapter, we will look into Node.js application deployment on real servers. Running code on our laptop is cool, but to hit the big time, the application needs to be properly deployed."/>
