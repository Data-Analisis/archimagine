    documentation="Version number matching in npm is powerful and flexible. The same sort of version specifiers used in package.json dependencies can also be used with the npm install command:&#xA;   $ npm install package-name@tag&#xA;   $ npm install package-name@version&#xA;   $ npm install package-name@version-range&#xA; The last two are what they sound like. You can specify express@4.16.2 to target a precise version, or express@&quot;>4.1.0 &lt; 5.0&quot; to target a range of Express V4 versions.&#xA;The version match specifiers include these choices:&#xA;Exact version match: 1.2.3&#xA;At least version N: >1.2.3&#xA;Up to version N: &lt;1.2.3&#xA;Between two releases: >=1.2.3 &lt;1.3.0&#xA;The @tag attribute is a symbolic name such as @latest, @stable, or @canary. The package owner assigns these symbolic names to specific version numbers, and can reassign them as desired. The exception is @latest, which is updated whenever a new release of the package is published.&#xA;For more documentation, run these commands: npm help json and npm help npm-dist-tag."/>
