    documentation="We have talked about several types of modules: CommonJS, JSON, ES2015, and native code modules. All but the ES2015 modules are loaded using the require function. That function has a very powerful and flexible algorithm for locating modules within a directory hierarchy. This algorithm, coupled with the npm package management system, gives the Node.js platform a lot of power and flexibility.&#xA;"/>
