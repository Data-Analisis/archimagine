    documentation="Quit scratching your head already! Of course you're doing it, scratching your head and mumbling to yourself, &quot;What's a browser language doing on the server?&quot; In truth, JavaScript has a long and largely unknown history outside the browser. JavaScript is a programming language, just like any other language, and the better question to ask is &quot;Why should JavaScript remain trapped inside browsers?&quot;.&#xA;Back in the dawn of the web age, the tools for writing web applications were at a fledgling stage. Some were experimenting with Perl or TCL to write CGI scripts, and the PHP and Java languages had just been developed. Even then, JavaScript saw use on the server side. One early web application server was Netscape's LiveWire server, which used JavaScript. Some versions of Microsoft's ASP used JScript, their version of JavaScript. A more recent server-side JavaScript project is the RingoJS application framework in the Java universe. Java 6 and Java 7 were both shipped with the Rhino JavaScript engine. In Java 8, Rhino was dropped in favor of the newer Nashorn JavaScript engine.&#xA;In other words, JavaScript outside the browser is not a new thing, even if it is uncommon."/>
