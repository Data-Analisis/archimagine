    documentation="You learned a lot in this chapter. Specifically, you saw that JavaScript has a life outside web browsers and you learned about the difference between asynchronous and blocking I/O. We then covered the attributes of Node.js and where it fits in the overall web application platform market and threaded versus asynchronous software. Lastly, we saw the advantages of fast event-driven asynchronous I/O, coupled with a language with great support for anonymous closures.&#xA;Our focus in this book is real-world considerations of developing and deploying Node.js applications. We'll cover as many aspects as we can of developing, refining, testing, and deploying Node.js applications.&#xA;Now that we've had this introduction to Node.js, we're ready to dive in and start using it. In Chapter 2, Setting up Node.js, we'll go over setting up a Node.js environment, so let's get started."/>
