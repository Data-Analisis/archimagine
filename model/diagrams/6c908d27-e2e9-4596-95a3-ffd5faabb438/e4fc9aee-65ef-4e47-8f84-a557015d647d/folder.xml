    documentation="In the previous two chapters, we built a small and somewhat useful application for storing notes, and then made it work on mobile devices. While the application works reasonably well, it doesn't store those notes anywhere on a long-term basis, meaning the notes are lost when you stop the server and, if you run multiple instances of Notes, each instance has its own set of notes. The typical next step is to introduce a database tier.&#xA;In this chapter, we will look at database support in Node.js, so the user sees the same set of notes for any Notes instance accessed, and to reliably store notes for long-term retrieval.&#xA;We'll start with the Notes application code used in the previous chapter. We started with a simple, in-memory data model using an array to store the notes, and then made it mobile friendly. In this chapter, we will:&#xA;Discover logging operational and debugging information Begin using the ES6 module format&#xA;Implement data persistence for Notes objects using several database engines&#xA;Let's get started!&#xA;The first step is to duplicate the code from the previous chapter. For instance, if you&#xA;were working in chap06/notes, duplicate that to be chap07/notes."/>
