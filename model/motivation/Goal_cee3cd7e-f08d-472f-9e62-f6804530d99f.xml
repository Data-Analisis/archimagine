    documentation="The objective is to support development of demonstration components that can be easily industrialized as Enterprise solution components, e.g. through integration in Enterprise Portal such as Liferay.&#xA;For the study, Liferay was selected as the most innovative Horizontal Enterprise Portal and as it is well positionned for usage of standard components for its evolutive architecture. So the choices made for Liferay are responding to well identified needs for a first class software product. Does it also respond to the needs for fast development of standalone demonstrators?&#xA;The requirements are:&#xA;1- usage of Open Source freee solution based on open standards, are freee and are of industrial quality &#xA;2- ability to produce responsive Web user Interface&#xA;3- to be a de facto standard, i.e. with a sufficiently active and important community of usage&#xA;4- to be easy to learn and to use&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;"/>
