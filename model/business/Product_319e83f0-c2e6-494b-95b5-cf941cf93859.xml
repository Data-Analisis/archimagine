    documentation="OpenMaprr: an interactive network visualization and exploratory network analysis tool. It lets users explore networks; discover and understand patterns in the structure of networks; see the landscape of communities and find structural leverage points in networked systems.&#xA;at https://www.openmappr.org/&#xA;Openmappr is a Rakuten Intelligence open-sourced project. “Mappr” was originally created by Vibrant Data with Kaustuv DeBiswas,  David Gurman, Rich Williams, Sundev Lohr, Aditya Vishwakarma, Bimal Kumar, Moumita Sen, and Eric Berlow. &#xA;Vibrant Data was acquired by Rakuten Intelligence in 2016. &#xA;&#xA;The root GitHub openmappr repository can be found here. See the GitHub documentation for how to install openmappr locally or on a server. If you want to publish shareable maps, you need to install and host openmappr on a server.&#xA;&#xA;This openmappr.org fork is experimenting with a focus on scientists as the primary user. &#xA;&#xA;Python scripts for generating a “similarity network” from items with associated tags (e.g., documents with keywords) can be found at Tag2Network on GitHub.&#xA;&#xA;Openmappr requires manually uploading csv, xls, or xlsx files… Our hope is to build a  python plotting library to render explorable networks directly from your scripts."/>
