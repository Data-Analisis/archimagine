    documentation="The Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) function has the highest level of decision-making and financial accountability for the products and Solutions in a SAFe portfolio. An effective LPM function is necessary for SAFe success, but it is typically a function, not an organization. The people who fulfill these responsibilities may have various titles and roles. But this function usually includes the business managers and executives who understand the Enterpriseâ€™s financial position and are ultimately responsible for portfolio strategy, operations, and execution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;"/>
