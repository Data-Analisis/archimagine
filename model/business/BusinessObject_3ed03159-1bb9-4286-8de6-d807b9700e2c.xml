    documentation="https://www.graphengine.io/&#xA;&#xA;Graph Engine = RAM Store + Computation Engine + Graph Model&#xA;Graph Engine (GE) is a distributed in-memory data processing engine, underpinned by a strongly-typed RAM store and a general distributed computation engine.&#xA;&#xA;The distributed RAM store provides a globally addressable high-performance key-value store over a cluster of machines. Through the RAM store, GE enables the fast random data access power over a large distributed data set.&#xA;&#xA;The capability of fast data exploration and distributed parallel computing makes GE a natural large graph processing platform. GE supports both low-latency online query processing and high-throughput offline analytics on billion-node large graphs."/>
