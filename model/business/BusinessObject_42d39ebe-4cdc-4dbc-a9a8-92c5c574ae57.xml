    documentation="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/&#xD;&#xA;RDF Schema provides a data-modelling vocabulary for RDF data. It is complemented by several companion documents which describe the basic concepts and abstract syntax of RDF [RDF11-CONCEPTS], the formal semantics of RDF [RDF11-MT], and various concrete syntaxes for RDF, such as Turtle [TURTLE], TriG, [TRIG], and JSON-LD [JSON-LD]. The RDF Primer [RDF11-PRIMER] provides an informal introduction and examples of the use of the concepts specified in this document.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This document is intended to provide a clear specification of RDF Schema to those who find the formal semantics specification [RDF11-MT] daunting. Thus, this document duplicates material also specified in the RDF Semantics specification. Where there is disagreement between this document and the RDF Semantics specification, the RDF Semantics specification should be taken to be correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;RDF Schema is a semantic extension of RDF. It provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and the relationships between these resources. RDF Schema is written in RDF using the terms described in this document. These resources are used to determine characteristics of other resources, such as the domains and ranges of properties. &#xD;&#xA;RDF Schema differs from many such systems in that instead of defining a class in terms of the properties its instances may have, RDF Schema describes properties in terms of the classes of resource to which they apply. This is the role of the domain and range mechanisms described in this specification&#xD;&#xA;"/>
