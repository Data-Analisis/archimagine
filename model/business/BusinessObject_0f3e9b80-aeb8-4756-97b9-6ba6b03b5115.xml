    documentation="With the growth of NoSQL, for which graph databases are a subclass, many new database query languages have been developed. SQL has always been the industry standard, but now there exists others such as CQL, Datalog, and XQuery. Even in the graph database space there is SPARQL, Cypher, GraphQL, and of course, Gremlin. Much like the Java virtual machine is a host to multiple programming languages including Java, Scala, Groovy, Clojure, JavaScript, etc., the Gremlin traversal machine is a host to multiple query languages. The Gremlin traversal machine's instruction set ensures Turing Completeness and as such, any query language can compile to execute on the Gremlin traversal machine. There are three types of language designers. Below, each type will demonstrate the &quot;same traversal&quot; expressed in different languages. Ultimately, they all compile to the Gremlin traversal below which computes the average rating for the projects created by Gremlin's friends. &#xD;&#xA;https://markorodriguez.com/2013/01/09/on-graph-computing/">
