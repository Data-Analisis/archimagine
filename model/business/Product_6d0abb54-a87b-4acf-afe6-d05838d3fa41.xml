    documentation="What is RethinkDB?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;RethinkDB is the first open-source, scalable JSON database built from the ground up for the realtime web. It inverts the traditional database architecture by exposing an exciting new access model – instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell RethinkDB to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB’s realtime push architecture dramatically reduces the time and effort necessary to build scalable realtime apps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to being designed from the ground up for realtime apps, RethinkDB offers a flexible query language, intuitive operations and monitoring APIs, and is easy to setup and learn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See the post Advancing the realtime web for more technical details on RethinkDB’s mission.&#xD;&#xA;When is RethinkDB a good choice?&#xD;&#xA;https://rethinkdb.com/faq&#xD;&#xA;RethinkDB is a great choice when your applications could benefit from realtime feeds to your data.&#xD;&#xA;The query-response database access model works well on the web because it maps directly to HTTP’s request-response. However, modern applications require sending data directly to the client in realtime. Use cases where companies benefited from RethinkDB’s realtime push architecture include:&#xD;&#xA;    Collaborative web and mobile apps&#xD;&#xA;    Streaming analytics apps&#xD;&#xA;    Multiplayer games&#xD;&#xA;    Realtime marketplaces&#xD;&#xA;    Connected devices&#xD;&#xA;"/>
