    documentation="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/&#xD;&#xA;his document defines the SHACL Shapes Constraint Language, a language for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions. These conditions are provided as shapes and other constructs expressed in the form of an RDF graph. RDF graphs that are used in this manner are called &quot;shapes graphs&quot; in SHACL and the RDF graphs that are validated against a shapes graph are called &quot;data graphs&quot;. As SHACL shape graphs are used to validate that data graphs satisfy a set of conditions they can also be viewed as a description of the data graphs that do satisfy these conditions. Such descriptions may be used for a variety of purposes beside validation, including user interface building, code generation and data integration. "/>
