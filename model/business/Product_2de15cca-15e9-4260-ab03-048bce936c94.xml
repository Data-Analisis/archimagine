    documentation="https://github.com/twilmes/sql-gremlin&#xA;Many projects face the inevitable reporting/business intelligence requirement. This has motivated the creation of the SQL-Gremlin compiler. A JDBC driver building upon the excellent Apache Calcite Avatica framework will be released shortly. This will enable graph connectivity with a large number of off the shelf reporting solutions that support ANSI SQL via JDBC."/>
