    documentation="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-DotNet&#xA;Apache TinkerPopâ€™s Gremlin.Net implements Gremlin within the C# language. It targets .NET Standard and can therefore be used on different operating systems and with different .NET frameworks, such as .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since the C# syntax is very similar to that of Java, it should be very easy to switch between Gremlin-Java and Gremlin.Net. The only major syntactical difference is that all method names in Gremlin.Net use PascalCase as opposed to camelCase in Gremlin-Java in order to comply with .NET conventions."/>
