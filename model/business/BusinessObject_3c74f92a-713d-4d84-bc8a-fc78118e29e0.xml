    documentation="http://sql2gremlin.com/&#xD;&#xA;SQL2Gremlin teaches Apache TinkerPop's Gremlin graph traversal language using typical patterns found when querying data with SQL. The format of the Gremlin results will not necessarily match the format of the SQL results. While SQL can only provide results in a tabular form, Gremlin provides various ways to structure a result set. Next, the Gremlin queries demonstrated are for elucidatory purposes and may not be the optimal way to retrieve the desired data. If a particular query runs slow and an optimal solution is desired, please do not hesitate to ask for help on the Gremlin-users mailing list. Finally, the SQL examples presented make use of T-SQL syntax. MySQL users may not know some of the expressions (e.g. paging), but should be able to understand the purpose of the query."/>
