    documentation="Vistorian: an open-source online visualization platform for historians. You can map your CSV data tables to a network and visualize it.&#xA;at http://vistorian.net/&#xA;Networkcube is a java script / (Typescript) library and a programming framework for interactive network visualizations with:&#xA;&#xA;different link types&#xA;multiple links between nodes&#xA;link weights&#xA;temporal information on links (weigth, existence)&#xA;geographical positions attached to nodes&#xA;The Vistorian is an application based on 'networkcube' and has been build with two goals in mind:&#xA;&#xA;Ready-to-use visualizations that can be embedded in any web environment, e.g. to provide state-of-the-art visualizations to a specific group of stateholders or in a specific domain.&#xA;Rapidly prototype, deploy, and mature novel network visualizations.&#xA;Browser-based: networkcube runs entirely in the browser and does not use any server. None of your data is transmitted over the network nor stored on any server.&#xA;Vistorian is designed for research and is currently in a prorotype phase. However, the code is open and contributions are welcome. Please read the Wiki for more information or contact us: benj.bach@gmail.com.&#xA;&#xA;Each visualization in Vistorian is its individual model and runs in an iFrame. Visualizations are hosted here on github and can be integrated in any website. So, the only thing your website has to care is importing a user's data into the browser (https://github.com/networkcube/networkcube/wiki/Importing-Data)."/>
